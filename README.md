# Timer2 – 8-bit Timer/Counter Module in AVR Microcontrollers
Timer2 is an 8-bit timer/counter peripheral in the ATmega328P microcontroller, commonly used for generating precise time delays, PWM signals, and event scheduling in embedded applications. This repository demonstrates how to configure and utilize Timer2 using PlatformIO and VSCode, covering topics such as prescaler settings, interrupt handling, and waveform generation. It serves as a practical resource for learning timer-based programming in AVR systems.

# 💻 How to Use Git and GitHub
To access the repository files and save them on your computer, there are two methods available:
1. **Using Git Bash and Cloning the Repository**
   - This method is more suitable for advanced users and those familiar with command-line tools.
   - By using this method, you can easily receive updates for the repository.

2. **Downloading the Repository as a ZIP file**
   - This method is simpler and suitable for users who are not comfortable with command-line tools.
   - Note that with this method, you will not automatically receive updates for the repository and will need to manually download any new updates.

## Clone using the URL.
First, open **Git Bash** :
-  Open the folder in **File Explorer** where you want the library to be stored.
-  **Right-click** inside the folder and select the option **"Open Git Bash here"** to open **Git Bash** in that directory.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you do not see the "Open Git Bash here" option, it means that Git is not installed on your system.  
> You can download and install Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  
> For a tutorial on how to install and use Git, check out [this video](https://youtu.be/BsykgHpmUt8).
  
-  Once **Git Bash** is open, run the following command to clone the repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/aKaReZa75/AVR_Timer2.git
```
- You can copy the above command by either:
- Clicking on the **Copy** button on the right of the command.
- Or select the command text manually and press **Ctrl + C** to copy.
- To paste the command into your **Git Bash** terminal, use **Shift + Insert**.
